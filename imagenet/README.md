# ImageNet
This directory contains a pytorch implementation of the ImageNet experiments for five pruning methods:  
1. L1-norm based channel pruning   
2. Regression based feature reconstruction  
3. Network Slimming  
4. Sparse Structure Selection  
5. ThiNet  
6. Non-structured weight-level pruning  

## Implementation
Our implementation is based on Pytorch ImageNet training [script](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/0.3.1/imagenet/main.py).

## Dependencies
torch v0.3.1, torchvision v0.2.0
