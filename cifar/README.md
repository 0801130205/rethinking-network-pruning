# CIFAR Experiments
This directory contains all the CIFAR experiments in the paper, where there are three pruning methods in total:  
1.  L1-norm based channel pruning  
2.  Network Slimming  
3.  Non-structured weight level pruning 

For each method, we give example commands for baseline training, finetuning, scratch-E training and scratch-B training.
